# KMP-Intrusion-Detection-System
This IDS focuses on detecting intrusion attempts by matching patterns in network data (such as suspicious strings in payloads or requests). It integrates the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string-search algorithm for efficient pattern matching while also using auxiliary methods such as hashing and tries for indexing or rule-based detection.

This is an ongoing project and will be updated as I work on it. 
## Features

- **Efficient Pattern Matching**: Utilizes the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for fast and efficient string searching.
- **Auxiliary Methods**: Incorporates hashing and tries for indexing and rule-based detection.
- **Real-time Detection**: Capable of analyzing network data in real-time to detect intrusion attempts.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and integrate with other systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KMP-Intrusion-Detection-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd KMP-Intrusion-Detection-System
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the IDS:
    ```sh
