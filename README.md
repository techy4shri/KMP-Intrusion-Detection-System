# KMP-Intrusion-Detection-System
This IDS focuses on detecting intrusion attempts by matching patterns in network data (such as suspicious strings in payloads or requests). It integrates the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string-search algorithm for efficient pattern matching while also using auxiliary methods such as hashing and tries for indexing or rule-based detection.
